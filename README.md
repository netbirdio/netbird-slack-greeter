# NetBird Slack Greeter

This Go-based application, residing in the `bot` folder, is designed to integrate with Slack for the NetBird community. It handles events from Slack's Socket Mode, offering automated responses to events of users joining the workspace or joining selected channels.

## Features

- **Automated Responses**: Automatically sends welcome messages to new users in specific channels or the entire workspace.
- **Template-based Messaging**: Employs predefined templates for different channels and events.
- **Event Handling**: Listens and responds to Slack events, like users joining a channel or the workspace.
- **Logging**: Uses `logrus` for structured logging, enhancing traceability and debugging.

## Requirements

- Go (tested with version 1.21.x or later, but probably work with older versions)
- Slack App Token (`SLACK_APP_TOKEN`) with the prefix `xapp-`
- Slack Bot Token (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`) with the prefix `xoxb-`
